Opponent Process
----------------

Visual opponent-process model.

Functions are defined in the **opponent_process** package.
Some utilities and plotting functions are defined in the subpackages opponent_process/**utils** and opponent_process/**plotting** respectively.

Three *main_xxx_xxx.py* files show a (hopefully) easy to follow logic for using the model.

 **Please note**: The simulation engine, running on OpenGL, used to render the virtual worlds, is not made public yet, so you must use your own engine in the meantime. Sorry for the inconvenience.
